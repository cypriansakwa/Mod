This Rust program shows how to conduct a modulo operation on huge numbers while assuring that the result is always non-negative, even if the starting number is negative. 
The programÂ applies the modulo operation to two huge numbers, a and b, and outputs the result. 
It employs i64 to handle huge integers and contains a check to ensure that the result is non-negative.
